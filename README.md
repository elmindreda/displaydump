# Idiosyncratic Win32 monitor and display information dumper

## About

This tool dumps every piece of information relevant for GLFW from the Win32
display device and display monitor APIs.

It is very likely useless outside of that context.


## Building

Configure with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and build with MinGW or Visual C++.
